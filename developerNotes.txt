This app was built using HTML5 and Tailwind CSS.

To use tailwind you can find a TailWind executable in the files, but this one will only run on linux based systems.
If you are using windows you can install tailwind from their site.

https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation

Anything you need to know about tailwind can also be found on their site. It is very simple once you get the hang of it!
The files are found in the ./assets/css/ folder.
