              Troy Patton is a California native.  He grew up in Long Beach at his dad’s roping arena.
               Horses have always been part of his life. He started participating in rodeos at the age
              of 16, where he rode bulls, team roped and calf roped.  At age 19 he went into the U.S.
              Army and served a tour of duty in Vietnam.  He left that war-torn country on Friday the
              13 th and, after crossing the International Dateline, was released from the U.S. Army on

              I started packing into the Sierra on hunting trips in about 1995. I became a member of
              BCHC’s Kern Sierra Unit more than 20 years ago. They had their spring ride on a
              private ranch and you had to be a member to ride. I had no idea what BCHC was at
              the time. Since then, I have held many leadership positions in my unit including
              President, Vice President and Education chair (forever!). At the State BCHC level I have

              who grew up in the area, returned here with his family when I was young. My father loved this area and
              everything outdoors, especially the backcountry, animals, and gardening, and he instilled the love of the
              nature and public lands in me.

              Larry has been an active member of BCHC Shasta Trinity Unit for 25 years. He has served on the Shasta Trinity Unit board 20 years. In those years he has been our Unit President 3 times totaling 9 years, Unit representative to the state board 7 years plus served many other functions for the Unit board

              This all started when his wife talked to a gentleman while waiting in line at the grocery store. He told her about Backcountry Horsemen, and she said we should join. By the next year Larry was on the local board, learning to pack while learning to ride. In one year, went from having 2 riding horses to 4 so they could pack. He currently have 2 horses and 4 mules and still love getting out to the mountains and pack each summer as much as possible.

            </p>
            <p class="p-2 md:p-4 lg:p-4">
              Larry love the mountains and went to what is now the Trinity Alps Wilderness for the first time in the summer of 1964. In 1968 I spent 3and ½ months hitchhiking the west trout fishing (took the summer off) and visited many areas that would become wilderness areas. Larry has since been a bar manager, an engineering technician for the State of California and retired from the Department of Water Resources as Systems Analyst in 2007.

              Terry Jorgensen joined the San Diego unit of BCHC in the early 1990s, shortly after
              moving to Ramona with her human and equine family.  Within the first year or two, at
              the annual election of officers, it was clear her unit needed someone in the Public Lands
              position. While she had no real idea of what that entailed, Terry volunteered and served
              in that role for about 20 years, thanks to wonderful mentors in BCHC.  She is now
              president of the Manzanita Riders Unit and looking forward to the next 20 years.

              I started packing into the Sierra on hunting trips in about 1995. I became a member of
              BCHC’s Kern Sierra Unit more than 20 years ago. They had their spring ride on a
              private ranch and you had to be a member to ride. I had no idea what BCHC was at
              the time. Since then, I have held many leadership positions in my unit including
              President, Vice President and Education chair (forever!). At the State BCHC level I have
              served as 1 st VP (Insurance), 2 nd VP (Volunteer Hours), and am currently the Co-VP of
              Youth Education and the Custodian of Records.

              Nate and I have been married 22 years. We got engaged on a Kern Sierra Unit work
              party in Kern Flats on the Kern River. We currently reside on a small ranch in Caliente,
              California. I am a mother/stepmother to five children, the grandmother of 10, and have
              one great grandchild (so far). I am blessed with a beautiful family, wonderful friends

              I joined Mid Valley Unit of Backcountry Horsemen of California sometime in 1989 or ‘90.
              At the time, I was dating a BCHC member who had a horse and riding mule and I
              wanted to join in on the unit’s fun-sounding work “parties” and other riding and social
              activities. It wasn’t long before I had my own riding mule, a truck and trailer, a ranchette
              for keeping it all, and had become deeply involved in administration of BCHC.
            </p>
            <p class="p-2 md:p-4 lg:p-4">
              I served as Mid Valley Unit’s secretary for many years, helped put together the unit’s
              monthly newsletter, developed curriculum for teaching packing classes, helped put on
              educational events, chaired the annual Columbia Christmas Parade for about 10 years,
              served on Rendezvous Committees for the events held in Turlock, and was elected the
              unit’s first (and so far, only) woman president.
            </p>
            <p class="p-2 md:p-4 lg:p-4">
              My first elected position in state BCHC was as Alternate National Director to Back
              Country Horsemen of America for the year 2000. I never got to do anything, however,
              because neither of the Directors ever missed a meeting. In 2001, I was elected BCHC
              Secretary and served until 2005 under the leadership of BCHC Presidents Toby Horst
              and John Keyes. When the BCHC Newsletter Editor position became vacant, I moved
              to that job and served from 2005 through 2011. After a hiatus during which I edited
              Woodbridge LIFE, the monthly paper for the Woodbridge/Del Webb 55+ community in
              Manteca, as well as Renaissance, the monthly newsletter for the nonprofit Peer
              Recovery Art Project in Modesto, in September 2020, I again became BCHC’s Editor. In
              addition to editing the BCHC paper, I served on the Insurance Committee and am
              currently serving on the Bylaws Committee.

            <p class="p-2 md:p-4 lg:p-4">
              I was born in Seattle, Washington, earned both bachelor’s and master’s degrees from
              the University of Washington and have worked in a variety of different jobs from
              insurance adjuster to reference librarian to supervisor and manager. In 1980, I moved to
              Modesto, California, where I began working for Stanislaus County. After 30 years, I
              retired from county employment in 2010. I have been married to Larry Schneider since
              2006. Larry’s career was as Bottling Director for Woodbridge Winery/Robert Mondavi in
              Lodi, California. I have one son, Andrew, who lives in Surprise, Arizona, with his wife
              and our two terrific teenage grandsons. Larry has two sons, one in Stockton, California,
              and the other in Farmington, Missouri.

            <p class="p-2 md:p-4 lg:p-4">
              I enjoy worldwide traveling, camping in our motor home (and little vintage trailer),
              boating and other water activities, reading and knitting. I am Recording Secretary for my
              P.E.O. chapter, an international women’s philanthropic and educational organization,

              Larry and I moved to Long Lake in Olympia, Washington, in October 2019, but that
              doesn’t stop me from being active in BCHC. I sincerely enjoy creating The Backcountry
              News every quarter. I learn something new and improve my editing and pagination skills
              with every edition. It’s fun to be inventive and to work with members of other BCHC
              units, and I am proud to produce a paper that represents our organization in a
              professional way.

              This all started when his wife talked to a gentleman while waiting in line at the grocery store. He told her about Backcountry Horsemen, and she said we should join. By the next year Larry was on the local board, learning to pack while learning to ride. In one year, went from having 2 riding horses to 4 so they could pack. He currently have 2 horses and 4 mules and still love getting out to the mountains and pack each summer as much as possible.

              Larry love the mountains and went to what is now the Trinity Alps Wilderness for the first time in the summer of 1964. In 1968 I spent 3and ½ months hitchhiking the west trout fishing (took the summer off) and visited many areas that would become wilderness areas. Larry has since been a bar manager, an engineering technician for the State of California and retired from the Department of Water Resources as Systems Analyst in 2007.

In the mid 1980s he made his way down to sunny Southern California where he met and married his wife of 39 years. In 2008, Mike began packing in trail crews for the Pacific Crest Trail Association (PCTA) and soon after that joined his local BCHC unit, Redshank Riders. He continues to pack for a number of agencies and also serves as a Saw Instructor for BCHC and PCTA.

              I started packing into the Sierra on hunting trips in about 1995. I became a member of
              BCHC’s Kern Sierra Unit more than 20 years ago. They had their spring ride on a
              private ranch and you had to be a member to ride. I had no idea what BCHC was at
              the time. Since then, I have held many leadership positions in my unit including
              President, Vice President and Education chair (forever!). At the State BCHC level I have
              served as 1 st VP (Insurance), 2 nd VP (Volunteer Hours), and am currently the Co-VP of

              Nate and I have been married 22 years. We got engaged on a Kern Sierra Unit work
              party in Kern Flats on the Kern River. We currently reside on a small ranch in Caliente,
              California. I am a mother/stepmother to five children, the grandmother of 10, and have
              one great grandchild (so far). I am blessed with a beautiful family, wonderful friends

              who grew up in the area, returned here with his family when I was young. My father loved this area and
              everything outdoors, especially the backcountry, animals, and gardening, and he instilled the love of the
              nature and public lands in me.

              annual pack trips into the Golden Trout Wilderness.

              I love children and was fortunate to work for Porterville Unified School District for 46 years, with the last
              twenty plus years at the District Office. Upon retirement, I worked for 2 years at Lowes in their nursery
              as the Plant Merchandiser, passing on my love of plants and gardening to their customers. I worked as a
              Veterinary Assistant briefly for a local Veterinarian surrounded by another love of mine, animals. I
              currently am employed by the US Forest Service at the Sequoia National Forest Supervisor’s Office. I am
              the Central California Regional Coordinator for IMPS (Internet Miniature Pinscher Services) a national

              My life has not always gone smoothly, but getting out, volunteering, and helping others has put my
              problems in perspective since there are many people whose circumstances make mine look insignificant.
              The rewards I have experienced from giving are numerous and I will continue to assist where I can for as

              volunteering as I am.
